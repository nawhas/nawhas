Oh my beloved child, I’ve spent my whole life in wait

For you to arrive as a gift from the Ahlulbayt (AS)

So from this day forward I make this vow

That I’ll raise you such that you’ll make them proud



(This is the lesson we’ll teach our children, Oh Hussain, Oh Hussain) x2



1.     show love to all of humanity

help those within your community

and in their times of difficulty

stand by your brothers with unity

help those who need you when they're in trouble

your masters message is universal

Oh Hussain, Oh Hussain



(This is the lesson we’ll teach our children, Oh Hussain, Oh Hussain) x2



2.     always make sure Allah is pleased

when you're in trouble say Ya ali

and send Allah's blessings upon

muhammed and, his family

this is the key to success in your life

and follow this path towards paradise

Oh Hussain, Oh Hussain



(This is the lesson we’ll teach our children, Oh Hussain, Oh Hussain) x2



3.     one day we'll walk to Karbala

where millions will join us from afar

at the door of maula ali

our journey will start inshallah

like lady zainab we will do the walk

with tears in our eyes to him we will flock

Oh Hussain, Oh Hussain



(This is the lesson we’ll teach our children, Oh Hussain, Oh Hussain) x2



4.     if you go to the door of abbas

with wishes in your heart and you ask

babul hawaij will listen and

your prayers will be fulfilled so fast

you will never go back empty handed

and all of your wishes will be granted

Oh Hussain, Oh Hussain



(This is the lesson we’ll teach our children, Oh Hussain, Oh Hussain) x2



5.     before you drink water you should say

Salaam upon you imam husain

before a drop touches your lips

never forget his thirst and pain

remember ali Asghar with sorrow

Whose thirst was quenched with a three pronged arrow

Oh Hussain, Oh Hussain



(This is the lesson we’ll teach our children, Oh Hussain, Oh Hussain) x2



6.     Aun and Muhammed look what they gave

like them you should.. also behave

don't be afraid to stand for what's right

you're never too young to be brave

listen to me my daughters and my sons

always be strong in your heart my lions

Oh Hussain, Oh Hussain



(This is the lesson we’ll teach our children, Oh Hussain, Oh Hussain) x2



7.     remember the imam of your time

for him may your life be sacrificed

rocking the cradle through the night

to you I sing this lullaby

in every action, intention and deed

always prepare for your maula mehdi

Oh Hussain, Oh Hussain



(This is the lesson we’ll teach our children, Oh Hussain, Oh Hussain) x2



8.     there is no honour that is so great

than serving the holy Ahlulbayt

tejani brothers for this we pray

that our children are blessed with this fate

may this live on in ar generations

to spread your mission in every nation

Oh Hussain, Oh Hussain



(This is the lesson we’ll teach our children, Oh Hussain, Oh Hussain) x2



This is our message to ISIS and all the terrorists

We’ll teach our children to love all of humanity

Though they are kids they’ll break your aim

And make you bow your head in shame

You will not kill, you will not maim

You will not hurt in our name
