(Ya Abbas) X7



As I See My Reflection In You, I Would Take Death Or Pain

I Just Want To Get You, To The Children Of Husain

(Oh Furat) X3



1.    When I Hold You In My Palms

My Soul And My Heart Break

As I See The Children's Face

My Two Hands Begin To Shake

I Hear The Cries Of Al Atash

They Are Calling Out My Name

I Just Want To Get You, To The Children Of Husain

(Oh Furat) X3



As I See My Reflection In You, I Would Take Death Or Pain

I Just Want To Get You, To The Children Of Husain

(Oh Furat) X3



2.    My Parched Lips Will Stay Dry

Despite Three Days Of Thirst

Until All Of The Children Drink

I Won't Drink A Drop First

In You I Can Just See Their Face

My Grief I Cannot Contain

I Just Want To Get You, To The Children Of Husain

(Oh Furat) X3



As I See My Reflection In You, I Would Take Death Or Pain

I Just Want To Get You, To The Children Of Husain

(Oh Furat) X3



3.    Throughout All Arabia

I Am Known For My Loyalty

My Name Is The One Called

When There Is A Difficulty

My Heart Can Never Bear

To See Anyone In Pain

I Just Want To Get You, To The Children Of Husain

(Oh Furat) X3



As I See My Reflection In You, I Would Take Death Or Pain

I Just Want To Get You, To The Children Of Husain

(Oh Furat) X3



4.    Look At Me I Am The Result

Of The Prayers Of Ali

My Eyes Did Not Open Until

My Master Hussain Held Me

From The Moment That I Was Born

This Has Been My Life's Aim

I Just Want To Get You, To The Children Of Husain

(Oh Furat) X3



As I See My Reflection In You, I Would Take Death Or Pain

I Just Want To Get You, To The Children Of Husain

(Oh Furat) X3



5.    With One Mission I Have Been Sent

Towards The Battlefield

To Bring Water Back And

For My Sword Not To Weild

My Master Gave Me This Command

And In His Love I Am Insane

 I Just Want To Get You, To The Children Of Husain

(Oh Furat) X3



As I See My Reflection In You, I Would Take Death Or Pain

I Just Want To Get You, To The Children Of Husain

(Oh Furat) X3



6.    All My Dreams And All Of My Hopes

Belong In That Water Flask

If That Ever Gets Pierced

It Will Be The End Of Abbas

I Will Not Return To The Tents

Because Of The Guilt And Shame

I Just Want To Get You, To The Children Of Husain

(Oh Furat) X3



As I See My Reflection In You, I Would Take Death Or Pain

I Just Want To Get You, To The Children Of Husain

(Oh Furat) X3



7.    An Arrow Is Deep In My Eye

I Have Lost Both Of My Hands

The Flask Is Clutched To My Teeth As

You Spill Out Upon The Sands

I Fall Onto The Ground Upon

My Face From The Horses Reins

I Just Want To Get You, To The Children Of Husain

(Oh Furat) X3



As I See My Reflection In You, I Would Take Death Or Pain

I Just Want To Get You, To The Children Of Husain

(Oh Furat) X3



8.    As It Brushed Against His Skin

To Abbas The Water Replied

Through You My Name Will Be Known

We Will Stay Side By Side

So That I Can Kiss Your Feet

In Honour As Your Slave

For All Of Eternity

I Will Circle Your Grave

(Oh Abbas) X3
