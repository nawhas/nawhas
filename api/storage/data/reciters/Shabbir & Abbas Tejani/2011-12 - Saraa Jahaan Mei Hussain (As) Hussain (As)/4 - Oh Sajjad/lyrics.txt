Sajjad, Sajjad

Oh Sajjad, Oh Sajjad



Oh My Imam Zainul Abideen

Oh Sajjad



You Taught Us The Art Of Supplication

You Showed Us The Power Of Prostration

To Make Islam Our Lifes Foundation

And How To Ask Allah For Salvation

Such Is Your Status Oh Holy Soul

You Made Allahs Love Your Only Goal, Oh My Imam



Oh My Imam Zainul Abideen

Oh Sajjad



You Are The Great Grandson Of Muhammed

Inside Your Veins Flows The Purest Of Blood

You Came Down From Heaven Like A Rose Bud

And Left Your Scent Forever In This World

Your Name Will Live On Forever Now

Till Death You’ll Be In Our Hearts We Vow Oh My Imam



Oh My Imam Zainul Abideen

Oh Sajjad



You Were Imprisoned Your Feet Were In Chains

And On The Chains Splattered Were Your Blood Stains

Inside Your Heart Were The Scars Of Those Pains

Of What You Saw That Day On The Hot Plains

Oh You Are Patience Personified

You Thanked Allah Though Your Hands Were Tied Oh My Imam



Oh My Imam Zainul Abideen

Oh Sajjad



You Saw Your Fathers Head On That Spear,

Your Mothers Bear Headed And In Fear

Your Sister Was Treated So Severe

That Blood Was Pouring Down From Her Ear

And Yet You Were So Brave That You Spoke

And In That Courtyard The World Awoke Oh My Imam



Oh My Imam Zainul Abideen

Oh Sajjad



With Quaking Hands How You Dug A Small Grave

A Resting Place For Sakina To Lay

Her Shroud Was Her Shirt Covered In Blood Stains

‘Til End Of Time That Is How She Will Stay

Until Today She’s So Far From Home

The Prison Is Dark And She’s Alone Oh My Imam



Oh My Imam Zainul Abideen

Oh Sajjad



For Forty Long Years You Kept On Weeping

‘Cos In Your Mind Shaam Kept On Repeating

The Lashes You Got And All The Beating

For All These Feelings There Is No Healing

Those Memories Always Will Be Raw

Of What You Heard, Felt And What You Saw Oh My Imam



Oh My Imam Zainul Abideen

Oh Sajjad



Upon Your Death Bed You Cried Out And Said

Remembering Karbala Your Heart Bled

Your Seventy Two Loved Ones Were All Dead

Hussain Your Father Now Lay Beheaded

And Then The Tents Were Burnt To The Ground

Your Feet Were Tied And Your Hands Were Bound Oh My Imam



Oh My Imam Zainul Abideen

Oh Sajjad

You Are My Guidance My Inspiration

To Emulate You Is My Intention

In Every Moment, In Every Second

Your Love Will Flow In Me Like An Ocean

You Are The Leader Of All Of Man

So Please Give Us All A Helping Hand Oh My Imam



Oh My Imam Zainul Abideen

Oh Sajjad



I Wanna Follow In Your Direction

To Fight For Truth I Will Face Objection

For My Beliefs I Will Face Rejection

I Need Your Help I Need Your Protection

To Stand Against Falsehood Everyday

And Live My Life Master In Your Way Oh My Imam



Oh My Imam Zainul Abideen

Oh Sajjad



This Is The State Now Today In Bahrain

The True Believers Are Dying In Pain

The Tyrant Rulers Are Killing For Reign

They’re Shedding Innocent Blood Without Shame

Please Now Return Mehdi Our Imam

And Salvage Our Souls From All This Harm Oh My Imam



Oh My Imam Zainul Abideen

Oh Sajjad



Tejani Brothers Are Praying For This

Throughout The World One Day There Will Be Bliss

When Our Imam Comes And Rules With Justice

With Love And Peace We Will All Coexist

We Raise Our Hands, We Cry And We Say

We Pray For This Moment Everyday Oh My Imam



Oh My Imam Zainul Abideen

Oh Sajjad
