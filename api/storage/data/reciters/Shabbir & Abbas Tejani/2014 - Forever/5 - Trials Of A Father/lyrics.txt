(My Son Where Are You I Cant See, My Vision Has Deserted Me) X2



1.     Did I Raise You For This Day, To See You Drowned In Blood
This Is The Ultimate Test Of A Fathers Love
A Spear In Your Chest, Your Final Anguished Cries
My Heart Is Filled With Grief, Oh Apple Of My Eyes



(My Son Where Are You I Cant See, My Vision Has Deserted Me) X2



2.     I Hear Your Final Cries, To You I Try To Come
I Stumble And I Fall, Each Time I Try To Run
Crawling Across The Sand Upon My Hands And Knees
Your Father's On His Way, My Son Just Wait For Me



(My Son Where Are You I Cant See, My Vision Has Deserted Me) X2



3.     These Hands Upon Your Chest, What Do You Hide From Me
Is It That You Have Pain, Or A Wound From Which You Bleed
Please Let Your Father Help You In Your Time Of Need
And Move Your Hands Away From There So I Can See


(My Father Don’t Look Down Too Far, A Spear's Deep Inside My Heart) X2



4.     The Skies Are Witnessing Beneath The Scorching Sun
A Broken Father Looks Down At His Dying Son
Their Bodies Trembling, With Tears In Their Eyes
And They Embrace One Last Time As They Say Goodbye



(My Father Don’t Look Down Too Far, A Spear's Deep Inside My Heart) X2



5.     Father Avert Your Eyes How Can You Stand To See
You Know That There's A Spear Broken Inside Of Me
This Hand Of Mine Is Trying To Hide My Fatal Wound
It's Time I Know My Soul Will Be Departing Soon


(My Father Don’t Look Down Too Far, A Spear's Deep Inside My Heart) X2



6.     I Will Take Any Pain Your Pain I Cannot See
This Wound Will Hurt You More, More Than Its Hurting Me
But I Cannot Say No Father To Your Request
My Life Belongs To You, I Know That You Know Best


(My Lord This Is My Sacrifice, My Sons Dying Before My Eyes) X2



7.     One Knee Upon The Ground, One Knee Upon His Chest
Upon A Broken Spear, My Trembling Hands Rest
His Arm Around My Neck, His Hand Upon My Hand
I Beg For Patience For This Test That I Withstand


(My Lord This Is My Sacrifice, My Sons Dying Before My Eyes) X2



8.     Looking Towards Najaf, I Cry Out Ya Ali
The Test Of Khayber Was Nothing Compared To This
I Pull Upon The Spear Taking A Deep Breath In
In My Hand His Bleeding Heart, My Son No Longer Lives
