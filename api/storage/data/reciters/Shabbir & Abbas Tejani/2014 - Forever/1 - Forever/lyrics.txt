Hussain, Hussain, Hussain



Ever place on this earth

This whole universe

Will remember your name



You're immortalised

'Cause you sacrificed

Everything that you loved for His sake



Ya Hussain, ya Hussain



Forever your call

Will live in our soul

Our every beat and every breath

every moment every step

Will be Ya Hussain



1\. This is our promise to you Hussain

We will remember your grief and pain

Your sacrifices are not in vain

Your message lives on until today

Forever this world

Will call out your name

The cry from all of humanity

In every street in every city

Will be Ya Hussain



Forever your call

Will live in our soul

Our every beat and every breath

every moment every step

Will be Ya Hussain



2\. You stood against thirty thousand men

You were alone in that barren land

Your blood was splattered across the plains

And purified every grain of sand

Forever that land

Is liberated

Where millions flock to see your shrine

The chants on their lips all the time

Will be Ya Hussain



Forever your call

Will live in our soul

Our every beat and every breath

every moment every step

Will be Ya Hussain



3\. Hussain you taught us the way of life

You showed it to us through sacrifice

Your final stand and your final cries

Those moments were witnessed by the skies

Forever we will

Remember your day

It is a day that's like no other

The name the skies will cry forever

Will be Ya Hussain



Forever your call

Will live in our soul

Our every beat and every breath

every moment every step

Will be Ya Hussain



4\. The figure heads we look to today

They all take lessons from you Hussain

whoever struggles against injustice

The fight is theirs but you lead the way

Forever safe guard

And stand for your rights

These are the traits we’ve learnt from you

The meaning of honour and truth

Will be Ya Hussain



Forever your call

Will live in our soul

Our every beat and every breath

every moment every step

Will be Ya Hussain



5\. We say Hussain and we’re filled with hope

Your name enlightens our very soul

There will be a day this world will know

Who is Hussain and what is his goal

Forever living

Your revolution

your legacy shall never die

The movement that will always thrive

Will be Ya Hussain



Forever your call

Will live in our soul

Our every beat and every breath

every moment every step

Will be Ya Hussain



6\. We are the people that are oppressed

Because in your grief we beat our chest

They call us "Rafidh" but they forget

That Fatima prays for our health

Forever we shall

remember your grief

And even if we’re faced with death

The only name on our breath

Will be Ya Hussain



Forever your call

Will live in our soul

Our every beat and every breath

every moment every step

Will be Ya Hussain



7\. We are awaiting the 12th Hussain

When he we will reappear again

He will raise the standard of Abbas

And looking to us he will proclaim

Forever your reign

Shall always remain

And falsehood by nature should fail

the proof to us that truth prevails

Will be Ya Hussain



Forever your call

Will live in our soul

Our every beat and every breath

every moment every step

Will be Ya Hussain
