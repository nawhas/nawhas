Zainab stands there and looks on at Hussain

Upon arrows, Hussain lays there

He cries and says turn your face away

You won't be able to bear my pain



12 strikes to the neck of Hussain

As his soul departs he looks up and says

Oh Allah I gave you everything that I have

If I had to, I'd do it again



1\. Hussain looks into his killer's eyes

As he sits on his chest with a blunted knife

He takes the knife to the throat of Hussain

He hacks away at his neck again and again

He pulls Hussain by his bloodied beard

With the blood of Hussain his face is smeared

He laughs and says that your end is near

But Hussain says I have never feared



12 strikes to the neck of Hussain

As his soul departs he looks up and says

Oh Allah I gave you everything that I have

If I had to, I'd do it again



2\. The blazing sun, three days of thirst

Not a drop of water for any of us

I saw my six-month old in such distress

Drifting in and out of consciousness

In the grief of my son I lost my sight

I crawled on the sands to be by his side

I will never forget his final cries

As I pulled that spear from his insides



12 strikes to the neck of Hussain

As his soul departs he looks up and says

Oh Allah I gave you everything that I have

If I had to, I'd do it again



3\. A voice is heard around these plains

As a lady embraces the head of Hussain

She cries aloud, puts her neck on his head

I'm his mother cut my neck instead

It's the final strike and Hussain's last breath

He thanks Allah as he meets his death

Lady Zahra cries with a broken heart

As the head and the body come apart
