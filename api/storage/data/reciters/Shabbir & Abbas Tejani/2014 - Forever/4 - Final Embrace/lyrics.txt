No Matter What Trials I Face

The Memory Won’t Be Erased

Oh Father, The Final Embrace

No Matter What Trials I Face

The Memory Won’t Be Erased

Oh Father, The Final Embrace



1. In The Desert Where You Would Die

We Cried In Each Others Arms

Forever We Would Be Apart

‘Cause My Fate Would Be The Prison Of Shaam

We Both Will Be Bloodied And Bruised

And Buried Without A Shroud

The Only Difference Is

I Will Have No Loved Ones Around

A Dark And Secluded Jail

Is My Ultimate Resting Place

Oh Father, The Final Embrace



No Matter What Trials I Face

The Memory Won’t Be Erased

Oh Father, The Final Embrace

I’ll Never Forget That Day

Or The Moment That We Parted Ways

Oh Father, The Final Embrace



2. I Crawled On My Hands And Knees

And Clung Onto Your Horses Hooves

I Cried And I Pleaded With Him

To Stay Still And Not To Move

Please Don’t Take My Father Away

I Can’t Sleep Without His Chest

He Has Been Left All Alone

Please Don’t Take Him To His Death

He Is Broken And Wounded

And Thirsty For Many Days

Oh Father, The Final Embrace



No Matter What Trials I Face

The Memory Won’t Be Erased

Oh Father, The Final Embrace

I’ll Never Forget That Day

Or The Moment That We Parted Ways

Oh Father, The Final Embrace



3. You Mean Everything To Me
The Best Father That Can Be
Whenever I Would Bed Asleep
I Would See You In My Dreams
You'd Catch Me When I Would Fall
You'd Come Running When I'd Call
I'd Always Sleep On Your Chest
Oh Father Do You Recall?
Now Watching You My Heart Breaks
When I See The Tears On Your Face
Oh Father, The Final Embrace



No Matter What Trials I Face

The Memory Won’t Be Erased

Oh Father, The Final Embrace

I’ll Never Forget That Day

Or The Moment That We Parted Ways

Oh Father, The Final Embrace



4. I Have Lost So Much Today
I've Seen Everyone Get Slayed
I Can't Bear To Lose You Too
Oh My Father Please Just Stay
I Will Trouble You No More
I Will Sleep Upon The Floor
Please Stay With Me I Implore
You Know That I'm Only Four
You Know That This Is No Age
To Leave Me Without A Trace

Oh Father, The Final Embrace



No Matter What Trials I Face

The Memory Won’t Be Erased

Oh Father, The Final Embrace

I’ll Never Forget That Day

Or The Moment That We Parted Ways

Oh Father, The Final Embrace



5. You Got Off Your Horse And Smiled

Then Opened Your Arms To Me

I Ran Into Your Embrace

And Held You So Lovingly

I Said If You Have To Go

I Have Got One Last Request

For Only A Little While

Please Let Me Sleep On Your Chest

You Laid On The Burning Sands

Without Uttering A Phrase

Oh Father, The Final Embrace



No Matter What Trials I Face

The Memory Won’t Be Erased

Oh Father, The Final Embrace

I’ll Never Forget That Day

Or The Moment That We Parted Ways

Oh Father, The Final Embrace



6. I Placed My Head On Your Chest

And As My Eyes Shut I Saw

A Lady Dressed All In Black

She Cried Out Let My Son Go

He May Cradle You Right Now

But Soon I Will Cradle Him

When He Falls From That Great Height

And Brutally Will Be Killed

I Got Off Immediately

With Tears In My Eyes I Said

Oh Father The Final Embrace



No Matter What Trials I Face

The Memory Won’t Be Erased

Oh Father, The Final Embrace

I’ll Never Forget That Day

Or The Moment That We Parted Ways

Oh Father, The Final Embrace



7. You Told Me To Make You Proud

As We Said Our Last Goodbyes

You Told My Trials And Woes

And Onto Your Horse You Climbed

You Rode Into The Distance

My Eyes Fixed On Your Silhouette

And When You Fell Off I Heard

The Dagger On Your Pure Neck

They Threw Your Head In My Laps

In The Night Of The Displaced

Oh Father, The Final Embrace



No Matter What Trials I Face

The Memory Won’t Be Erased

Oh Father, The Final Embrace

I’ll Never Forget That Day

Or The Moment That We Parted Ways

Oh Father, The Final Embrace



8. In The Palace Your Pure Head

Was Placed On The Balcony

Let’s See How Strong Your Love Is

The Tyrant Said Mockingly

With My Tiny Hands In Chains

I Opened Them Out To You

Your Head Came Into My Arms

And No One Knew What To Do

I Smiled Lovingly At You

And Placed My Cheeks On Your Face

Oh Father, The Final Embrace



No Matter What Trials I Face

The Memory Won’t Be Erased

Oh Father, The Final Embrace

I’ll Never Forget That Day

Or The Moment That We Parted Ways

Oh Father, The Final Embrace



9. The Dark Nights Of The Prison

A Place I Will Not Forget

In My Final Moments There

I Missed You So Much And Wept

To Silence My Endless Cries

Your Killers Returned Your Head

I Held Your Head To My Chest

I Then Shut My Eyes And Slept

My Heart Finally At Peace

I Never Awoke Again

Oh Father, The Final Embrace
