Imam Hussain (AS) on the day of Ashura gave everything up for Allah (SWT) so
that we could remain free and that Islam could remain alive today.

Do you remember when he said Halmin nasirin yansurna â€“ is there anyone to help
me? We were not there when Imam Hussain (AS) said that but remember that we
can help him today by being good Muslims, by always remembering his message,
and by preparing to help the Imam of our time, Imam Mehdi (ATF)



We are your young army

Oh Hussain and Mehdi

We are yours, we are yours we are yours



You have inspired us to be

The best that we can be

And from your tragedy

We have learnt how to live

We will always stay strong

Standing up against what is wrong

We are yours, we are yours, we are yours



We are your young army

Oh Hussain and Mehdi

We are yours, we are yours we are yours

We can change this world for good

Stand for why you had stood

We will fight for the truth

Being brave in our youth

We know it's our duty

To prepare for Mehdi

We are yours, we are yours, we are yours



We are your young army

Oh Hussain and Mehdi

We are yours, we are yours we are yours



You have witnessed suffering

Your beloved perishing

Enemies were cheering

As your tents were all burning

We have learnt from your patience

To rely on God's wisdom

We are yours, we are yours we are yours



We are your young army

Oh Hussain and Mehdi

We are yours, we are yours we are yours



Seeing you is our dream

We pray one day we can be

By your side when you return

To reform the Prophet's deen

You are our saviour

We are your followers

We are yours, we are yours we are yours



We are your young army

Oh Hussain and Mehdi

We are yours, we are yours we are yours

This is what Qasim had taught

When he came bravely and fought

Nothing is sweeter than death

If you're on the path of God

We'll remember his message

and will show our courage

We are yours, we are yours we are yours



We are your young army

Oh Hussain and Mehdi

We are yours, we are yours we are yours



We will make sure God is pleased

Through our lives with our deeds

We will offer our help

When we see someone in need

We are the role models

for tomorrow's children

We are yours, we are yours we are yours



We are your young army

Oh Hussain and Mehdi

We are yours, we are yours we are yours

Karbala lives in our hearts

And we hate being apart

We will pray besides his shrine

as we hold onto the bars

When we're ever in need

We know he'll intercede

We are yours, we are yours we are yours



We are your young army

Oh Hussain and Mehdi

We are yours, we are yours we are yours
