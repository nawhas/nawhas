Karbala, Karbala, Karbala





Take me to Karbala, Karbala Karbala, Karbala Karbala, Karbala Karbala



I am that beggar who comes to your door  

You will answer me of this I am sure  

the one who gave Fitrus his wings  

the one whose praises Allah sings  

do not turn me away

I've come from far away

waiting for just this day

To kiss your shrine and say



Take me to Karbala, Karbala Karbala, Karbala Karbala, Karbala Karbala



To see your shrine if they take my life away

I'd still come crawling to you oh Hussain

even if I face certain death

I'll call your name with every breath

even death can't stop me

it is my only dream

your shine I need to see

Hussain so desperately



Take me to Karbala, Karbala Karbala, Karbala Karbala, Karbala Karbala



without your love I'd not have a heartbeat

the blood in my veins the air that I breathe

you are my start you are my end  

you are more than I can understand  

don't let this distance grow

please call me to your door

look at my tears flow

I can't wait anymore



Take me to Karbala, Karbala Karbala, Karbala Karbala, Karbala Karbala





we have been tortured and been imprisoned  

we are killed daily without a reason

because we love you oh Hussain

and we call out your father's name

ya Ali we will say

as we will walk your way

every step every day

from your path we won't stray



Take me to Karbala, Karbala Karbala, Karbala Karbala, Karbala Karbala



even in my sleep I dream of your land

I wish to hold and to kiss the sand

the dust that cures every disease

and in itself can intercede

my master in this life

the only wish of mine

is to die by your side

holding your golden shrine



Take me to Karbala, Karbala Karbala, Karbala Karbala, Karbala Karbala



to be your servant is my life's aim  

everything for you I would give up hussain  

I wish I was there by your side

and for your love be sacrificed

despite all of my sins

my master in a blink

you gave me everything

only through your blessings



Take me to Karbala, Karbala Karbala, Karbala Karbala, Karbala Karbala



this is my promise to you oh Hussain

upon my death bed I’ll call out your name  

I know that in their final breath

you will cradle your lover’s head

please come to visit me

so my death can be sweet

take my hand when we meet

and in that time of need



Take me to Karbala, Karbala Karbala, Karbala Karbala, Karbala Karbala

  

the angels come down to circle your grave  

even the kings come to your door as slaves

millions crawl on their hands and knees

and come to you with all their needs

this Allah guarantees

you can change destinies

and grant us any wish

Rahib is proof of this



Take me to Karbala, Karbala Karbala, Karbala Karbala, Karbala Karbala
