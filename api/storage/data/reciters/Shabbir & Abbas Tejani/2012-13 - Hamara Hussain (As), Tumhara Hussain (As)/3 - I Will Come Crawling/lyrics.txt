Na’tiqa Za’fan Sayyidi Ya Hussain, Ya Hussain, Ya Hussain



They Can Cut My Arms And My Legs

They Can Take Everything That I Have

I Will Come Crawling To You Hussain



1.     Everyday It Cuts Me Inside

I’m So Very Far From Your Side

I Would Give Away These Eyes

Just To Catch A Glimpse Of Your Shrine

If I Have To Cross The Seas

And Every Desert In Between

I Will Come Crawling To You Hussain



They Can Cut My Arms And My Legs

They Can Take Everything That I Have

I Will Come Crawling To You Hussain



2.     I Can Tell You That I’m Insane

In The Love Of My Master Hussain

In This Universe There’s No Pain

That Can Ever Keep Me Away

Every Inch That I Come Your Way

Every Beat Of My Heart Will Say

I Will Come Crawling To You Hussain



They Can Cut My Arms And My Legs

They Can Take Everything That I Have

I Will Come Crawling To You Hussain



3.     If I Lose My Family And Friends

And My Life’s Coming To An End

If I Lose My Feet And Hands

If I Can No Longer Stand

If I Stumble A Thousand Times

If The Journey’s A Thousand Miles

I Will Come Crawling To You Hussain



They Can Cut My Arms And My Legs

They Can Take Everything That I Have

I Will Come Crawling To You Hussain



4.     You Just Have To Look At This World

See Your Lovers Are Tortured And Hurt

They Can Use Their Tanks And Their Guns

We Will Stand Together As One

They Can Tear Us Limb From Limb

But Our Soul Will Say From Within

I Will Come Crawling To You Hussain



They Can Cut My Arms And My Legs

They Can Take Everything That I Have

I Will Come Crawling To You Hussain

5.     They Can Put A Gun To My Head

And Can Threaten To Shoot Me Dead

They Can Wound Me Till I Am Red

They Can Try To Kill Me And Yet

With My Every Remaining Breath

With Every Ounce Of Strength I Possess

I Will Come Crawling To You Hussain



They Can Cut My Arms And My Legs

They Can Take Everything That I Have

I Will Come Crawling To You Hussain



6.     This Is Now My State Oh Hussain

I Am So Overwhelmed With Pain

Who Can I Turn To And Explain

All The Grief That My Heart Now Contains

Who Can I Now Call For Help

Pinning All My Hopes On Yourself

I Will Come Crawling To You Hussain



They Can Cut My Arms And My Legs

They Can Take Everything That I Have

I Will Come Crawling To You Hussain



7.     On The Plains Of Karbala

When You Said With A Heart So Scarred

Hal Min Nasirin Yansurna

Who Can Help Me In Times So Hard

Falling From The Cot To The Floor

Ali Asghar Gave This Call

I Will Come Crawling To You Hussain



They Can Cut My Arms And My Legs

They Can Take Everything That I Have

I Will Come Crawling To You Hussain



8.     They Say When You Breathe Your Last

You Recall Your Entire Past

When My Life Flashes Past So Fast

I Pray That In My Final Gasp

Death Will Be The Sweetest Taste

When I See Your Radiant Face

I Will Come Crawling To You Hussain



They Can Cut My Arms And My Legs

They Can Take Everything That I Have

I Will Come Crawling To You Hussain
