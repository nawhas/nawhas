**_On Our Way_** ** __**



So begins the journey of love

Love is a movement of the heart

It starts from the door of wilaayah (love of Ali (AS)) and it ends at this
brother of Zainab (SA)

Every step that you take, that heart increases in love

The eye begins to shine with tears

Thousands of people, in fact, millions of people moving in a direction

You look around you and you'll see, all you notice, that yearning that pushes
you and that yearning that pulls you like a magnet

Night turns into day and day turns into night

And as you come to the borders of Karbala, you look up, what do you hear?

You'll hear a voice, and that voice comes from the shrine of the master
itself, when he says to his brother, "oh brother greet them, for they are my
guests"

So at that moment when you begin to take those steps, a feeling goes through
your heart and that feeling is this

That even if my body was shattered into ashes and spread all over the world, I
would continue to come towards Hussain (AS)

And even if I was killed a thousand times and my body was burnt a thousand
times, then I would still come towards you Hussain (AS)

Know one thing - 1400 years have gone by, but today we still remember Hussain
(AS)

And we still say to Hussain (AS), labbayk ya Hussain (AS)
