Imam Mahdi, May Allah (Swt) Hasten His Reappearance, In Ziyarat Nahiyya Says:

Fala'andubannaka Šabāħan Wa Masā'ā,

Wa La'abkiyanna Laka Badalad-Dumūi Damā

So I Will Weep For You Morning And Evening

And I Will Keep Crying For You, Until I Cry Tears Of Blood



I See It So Clearly, I Feel All Of His Pain

Whenever I Close My Eyes I Just See The Head Of Hussain

So I’m Going To Cry, A River Of Blood Tonight

I See It So Clearly, I Feel All Of His Pain

Whenever I Close My Eyes I Just See The Head Of Hussain

So I’m Going To Cry, A River Of Blood Tonight



Assalāmu Alabni Khātamil Anbiyā',

Assalāmu Alabni Fāţimaz-Zahrā'

Assalāmu Alā Manil Ijābatu Taħta Qubbatih,

Assalāmu Alā Man Jaalal-Lāhush-Shifā'a Fī Turbatih



1.     The Son Of The Prophet, The High And The Holy,

The Loved One Of Zahra, The Purest Of Ladies

His Blessings Are Infinite, There Is No One Like Him

If You Stand Beneath His Dome, Your Prayers Are Guaranteed

His Status Is So Great, And His Blood Is So Pure

The Dust From Beside His Grave, For All Ailments Is A Cure

So I’m Going To Cry, A River Of Blood Tonight



I See It So Clearly, I Feel All Of His Pain

Whenever I Close My Eyes I Just See The Head Of Hussain

So I’m Going To Cry, A River Of Blood Tonight



Assalāmu Alā Gharībil Ghurabā'

Assalāmu Alā Shahīdish-Shuhadā

Assalāmu Alal Murrammali Bid-Dimā',

Assalāmu Alā Man Bakat-Hu Malā'ikatus-Samā'

2.     When I Stand In Karbala, I Just See A Lonely Man

Who Stands Covered In Blood, A Sword Clutched In His Hand

He Stares At His Loved Ones, Who Lay Lifeless On The Sands

He Knows That The Enemies, Will Soon Loot His Caravan,

The Angels Are Weeping, Whilst Watching Him In Pain

The Heavens Are Ringing, With Cries Of "Hussain, Hussain"

So I’m Going To Cry, A River Of Blood Tonight



I See It So Clearly, I Feel All Of His Pain

Whenever I Close My Eyes I Just See The Head Of Hussain

So I’m Going To Cry, A River Of Blood Tonight



Assalāmu Alar-Ru'ūsil Mushālāt

Assalāmu Alan-Niswatil Bārizāt

Assalāmu Alal Madfūnīna Bilā 'Akfān

Assalāmu Alar-Ru'ūsil Muffarraqati Anil 'Abdān



3.     May God Bless The Martyrs, Who Gave Their Lives For You

Whose Parched Lips Were Thirsty, They Were Covered In Wounds

Even Ali Asghar, Was Murdered In Plain View

Who Stared At The Arrow, And Only Let Out A Coo

Their Heads All Were Severed, And Raised High Upon Spears

Their Ladies Were Dragged In Chains, Without Veils And In Tears

So I’m Going To Cry, A River Of Blood Tonight



I See It So Clearly, I Feel All Of His Pain

Whenever I Close My Eyes I Just See The Head Of Hussain

So I’m Going To Cry, A River Of Blood Tonight



Assalāmu Alal Mughassali Bidamil Jirāħ,

Assalāmu Alal Mujarrai Bika'sātir-Rimāħ

Assalāmu Alash-Shaybil Khađhīb

Assalāmu Alal Khaddit-Tarīb



4.     The Skies All Become Dark, With Spears And Arrows

He Falls From His Horse As, The Blood From His Veins Flows

His Cheeks Strike Upon The Dust, Surrounded By Shadows

His Grey Hair Is Dyed With Blood, As They Butcher Him With Blows

He Lay With No Helper, To Save Him From Danger

His Unshrouded Body, Was Buried By Strangers

So I’m Going To Cry, A River Of Blood Tonight



I See It So Clearly, I Feel All Of His Pain

Whenever I Close My Eyes I Just See The Head Of Hussain

So I’m Going To Cry, A River Of Blood Tonight



Assalāmu Alayka Fa'innī Qašadtu 'Ilayk,

Wa Rajawtul Fawza Ladayk,

Salāmal Mafjūil Ħazīn,

Al-Wālihil-Mustakīn



5.     The Angels Are Circling, Your Shrine And The Place You Lay

I Pray That I Get The Chance, To Visit Your Holy Grave

My Breaths Choke In My Throat, When I Think Of Your Fate

I Wish I Had Been There, To Save You On That Day

So I Will Lament You, For The Rest Of My Life

But The Water From My Eyes, Will Run Out Every Night

So I’m Going To Cry, A River Of Blood Tonight



I See It So Clearly, I Feel All Of His Pain

Whenever I Close My Eyes I Just See The Head Of Hussain

So I’m Going To Cry, A River Of Blood Tonight



Qad Rashaħa Lil Mawti Jabīnuk

Wakhtalafat Bil Inqibāđhi Wal Inbisāţi Shimāluka Wa Yamīnuk,

Tudīru Ţarfan Khafiyyan 'Ilā Raħlika Wa Baytik,

Wa Qad Shughilta Binafsika An Wuldika Wa 'Ahālīk,



6.     You Were Drowning In Grief, And Thirsty For Three Days

And Yet You Were Patient, As The Angels Sang Your Praise

The Enemies Threw Stones, Until You Fell On The Plains

You Clenched And Unclenched Your Hands, They Circled You Like Prey

You Looked Towards Zainab, As They Ran To Kill You

With Tears In Your Eyes, Knowing What She'll Go Through

So I’m Going To Cry, A River Of Blood Tonight



I See It So Clearly, I Feel All Of His Pain

Whenever I Close My Eyes I Just See The Head Of Hussain

So I’m Going To Cry, A River Of Blood Tonight



Wash-Shimru Jālisun Alā Šadrik

Wa Mūlighon Sayfahu Alā Naħrik

Qābiđhun Alā Shaybatika Biyadih

Dhābiħun Laka Bimuhannadih



7.     The Ladies Rushed To You, On Your Chest Was Shimar

A Red Carpet Of Blood, The Air Filled With Laughter

Your Vision Was Fading, As Your Breaths Were Shallower

Your Eyes Fixed On Zainab, As They Closed Forever

Your Head Raised Upon A Spear, As Your Tents Were Set Aflame

The Women And Children, Were Calling Abbas' Name

So I’m Going To Cry, A River Of Blood Tonight



I See It So Clearly, I Feel All Of His Pain

Whenever I Close My Eyes I Just See The Head Of Hussain

So I’m Going To Cry, A River Of Blood Tonight



Wa Subiya 'Ahluka Kal Abīd, Wa Šuffidū Fil Ħadīdi Fawqa 'Aqtābil Maţiyyāt

Talfaħu Wujūhahum Ħarrul Hājirāt

Aydīhim Maghlūlatun 'Ilal 'Anāq

Yuţāfu Bihim Fil 'Aswāq



8.     The Ladies Were Looted, And Dragged Through The Wastelands

From One Market To The Next, With Chains Binding Their Hands

The Sun Burnt The Bodies, Of This Pure Caravan

The Hooves Crushed The Children, That Fell Down Upon The Sands

With No Covering Or Veil, They Were All Paraded

They Were Hit With Fire And Stones, And They Were Degraded

So I’m Going To Cry, A River Of Blood Tonight



I See It So Clearly, I Feel All Of His Pain

Whenever I Close My Eyes I Just See The Head Of Hussain

So I’m Going To Cry, A River Of Blood Tonight

I See It So Clearly, I Feel All Of His Pain

Whenever I Close My Eyes I Just See The Head Of Hussain

So I’m Going To Cry, A River Of Blood Tonight
