Your daughters and sisters were paraded
Their hands were tied and they were unaided
The tyrant enemies were elated
But through allahs will their power faded

our names will live on and on instead

Hussain is your name, Hussain is your name
The one who was slain, The one who was slain
whose blood fell like rain
so much was your pain
we cry upon you, we cry upon you
the pious and true, the pious and true

you saved the world oh my third imaam
peace be upon you we send salaams

the meaning of peace has lost its essence

when allah chooses to lift the veil
then only truth and love will prevail
dishonesty and deceit will fail
