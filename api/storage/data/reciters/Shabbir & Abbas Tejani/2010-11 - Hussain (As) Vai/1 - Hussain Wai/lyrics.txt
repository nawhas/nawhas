Mazloom Bekas Tu Bewatan

Itna Gharib Tha Shah-E-Zaman

Haa(N) Teero(N) Pe Tha Tera Badan

Tera Lahu Tha Tera Kafan

Kaise Bhulaayei(N) Ham Wo Ghari

Tere Gale Pe Chali Churi

Khayme Ke Dar Pe Bahan Khari

Kehti Thi Zainab Roke Yahi

H’arqul Khiyaama Fi Karbala’

Man-Il-Ladhee Sayasaa’adna

Wa Sawfa Yamsah’ Damu’ana

Wa Yastami’oon Bukaa’na

Wa Yashfaqu ‘Ala ‘Haalana

Shab Hame Shab Asheghoone

Hey Mikhoonam Hussain Hussain

Yaadam Nemire Taa Abad

Shabaaye Beinolharamein.

Yadesh Bekheyr Che Hali Bood

Misookhtam Az Omghe Vojood

Masti Booodo Eshgh O Jonoon

Oon Naale O Ashk O Sojoood.

We Cant Control The Tears That Flow

Oh Master We All Want You To Know

The Flame Of Your Love Will Always Glow

In Our Hearts It Will Always Grow

Today Your Name Runs In Our Veins

When Our Heartbeats It Beats Your Name

On Our Lips Is Hussain Hussain

When We Hear Your Grief And Your Pain

Tumhara Gar Kaise Lutgaya

Qasim Ka Lasha Tukre Huwa

Soya Tha Ghazi Bazu Bina

Akbar Ko Ran Mei Neza Laga

Nanna Sa Asghar Khu(N) Mei Naha

Tumhara Pyasa Gala Kata

Zainab Ke Sar Se Chini Rida

Salaar-E-Kunba Abid Bana

The Brother That She Did So Adore

The One That She Did Love To Her Core

The Heart Of Zainab Stopped When She Saw

Your Headless Body Upon The Floor

To Trample You All The Horses Rushed

Beneath Their Hooves All Your Bones Were Crushed

From Every Piece Of Body Blood Gushed

Your Daughter Cried Saying Al-Atash

Your Deaths Were Such An Atrocity

And Yet You Thanked God Almighty

You Showed Love With High Intensity

And Treated Faith With Such Surety

You Sacrificed With Sincerity

And Are The Meaning Of Purity,

The Definition Of Piety

You Will Live On For Eternity

Karbobala Mei Thi Ye Sada

Hal Min Nasirin Yan Surna

Tamam Momin Ki Hai Buka

Labbayk Maula Ki Hai Sada

Har Ik Zubaa(N) Pe Hai Ye Tera

Juloos-O-Majlis Nawha Aza

Sara Jahaa(N) Hai Ye Bolta

Hussain Hussain, Hussain Maula Mera



(Hussain Wai, Wai, Wai) X2



You Put Your Head In Sujood And Said

This Is The Promise That I Had Made

That Every Drop Of Blood I Would Shed

For You My Lord I Would Give My Head

I Am Coming Back To You Allah

Accept This Deed In Karbobala

A Voice Came From Up Above Afar

Come Back Oh Nafsul Mutmainnah

Nawha “Tejani” Ne Jo Likha

Tere Madad Se Jo Hai Parha

Ye Nawha Khaani Haaye Aza

Qabool Karlo Maula Mera

Hamare Lab Pe Hai Iltija

Roz-E-Qayamat Mei Do Sada

Ye Mere Bande Hai Ay Khuda

Qareeb Unko Mere Bulaa
