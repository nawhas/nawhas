I Could Not Do Anymore, I Promise My Hands Were Tied

As I Lay You In Your Grave All Alone Tonight

My Sister I’m Sorry, Please Forgive Me



1.     I Raised You With So Much Love, I Fed You With My Hands
I Could Never See You Cry, Your Wish Always Was My Command
I Used To Play With You, As Though We Were Best Friends
Today I Am Burying, You In This Foreign Land
You Were Always Frightened, Of The Dark When It Was Night
Forever You’ll Lay In, A Prison Where There’s No Light

My Sister I’m Sorry, Please Forgive Me



I Could Not Do Anymore, I Promise My Hands Were Tied

As I Lay You In Your Grave All Alone Tonight

My Sister I’m Sorry, Please Forgive Me



2.     The Palace Where We Were Stood, Our Necks And Our Hands In Chains
The Enemy Asked Are You The Daughter Of Hussain
A Tear Rolled Down Your Cheek, As They Laughed At His Pain
They Pointed And Told Us, To Come Forward By Our Names
An Evil Man Asked For You, To Be A Maid For Him
My Body Began To Shake, But I Could Not Move A Limb

My Sister I’m Sorry, Please Forgive Me



I Could Not Do Anymore, I Promise My Hands Were Tied

As I Lay You In Your Grave All Alone Tonight

My Sister I’m Sorry, Please Forgive Me



3.     Is This How This Brother, Will Get To Say Goodbye
Your Body Is Scolded, So Sunken Are Your Eyes
The Slaps You Have On Your Face, The Sound Of Your Final Cries
The State Of Your Body, Will Haunt Me Until I Die
As I Use My Bare Hands, To Make A Grave In The Ground
How Can I Forgive Myself, You Don’t Even Have A Shroud

My Sister I’m Sorry, Please Forgive Me



I Could Not Do Anymore, I Promise My Hands Were Tied

As I Lay You In Your Grave All Alone Tonight

My Sister I’m Sorry, Please Forgive Me

4.     Our Father Always Prayed, For A Daughter Like You
His One In A Million, Like Whom There Are So Few
He Found So Much Peace And Love, And Nurtured You As You Grew
He’s Crying On That Spear, As You’re Beaten Black And Blue
I Watch On In Horror, And See Him On The Spear
As Stones Are Thrown At Him, His Face Wet With Blood And Tears

My Sister I’m Sorry, Please Forgive Me



I Could Not Do Anymore, I Promise My Hands Were Tied

As I Lay You In Your Grave All Alone Tonight

My Sister I’m Sorry, Please Forgive Me



5.     We Watched In The Courtyard, Yazid Was In His Seat
Our Father’s Head Was Kept, On Top Of The Balcony
The Tyrant Took A Stick, And Hit Our Father’s Teeth
You Then Opened Your Arms, And Said Come To Me Please
His Head Lifted From That Place, And Landed In Your Laps
You Held On To His Head, As Your Face Was Being Slapped

My Sister I’m Sorry, Please Forgive Me



I Could Not Do Anymore, I Promise My Hands Were Tied

As I Lay You In Your Grave All Alone Tonight

My Sister I’m Sorry, Please Forgive Me

6.
The Night Of The Orphans, When The Tents Were All Ablaze
You Entered The Battlefield, Where Bodies Lay Like A Maze
You Found Our Father, On His Chest Your Cheeks You Placed
You Found Peace For Moments, Before We Were Dragged Away
We Walked On A Long Road, Where Nights Turned Into Days
And Tied To A Camel, Your Body Was In Chains

My Sister I’m Sorry, Please Forgive Me



I Could Not Do Anymore, I Promise My Hands Were Tied

As I Lay You In Your Grave All Alone Tonight

My Sister I’m Sorry, Please Forgive Me



_7.      _Those Nights In The Dungeons, Where You Weren't Allowed To Cry
You Stared Hopefully At, The Doves As They Used To Fly
You Wanted To Go Home, And Leave All This Hurt Behind
If You Asked For Freedom, You Would Get Slaps In Reply
I'd Say To Console You, That We Will Go Home Soon
But Now You Are Laying, Alone In A Darkened Tomb __

My Sister I’m Sorry, Please Forgive Me
