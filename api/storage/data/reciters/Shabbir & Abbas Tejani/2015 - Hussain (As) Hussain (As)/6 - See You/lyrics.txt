Going To Think Of You, On That Road Every Step Of The Way

Going To See You In My Dreams, See You Everyday



1.     Taking One Last, Look At You As You Leave

I See Fire, Now What Do You Perceive

Do You See Hearts, Broken Like Our Dreams

Or Our Tents Aflame, And All The Children's Screams

Going To Think Of You, As I Run Between Tents Ablaze

Going To See You In My Dreams, See You Every Day



Going To Think Of You, On That Road Every Step Of The Way

Going To See You In My Dreams, See You Everyday



2.     As You Stand Alone, You’re Looking Left And Right

Can I Just Ask You As You Leave To Fight

Since I Was Born, Have You Ever Left My Side

As You Walk You’ll See, My Footsteps By Your Strides

Going To Scream Aloud, As Your Pure Neck Is Hacked Away

Going To See You In My Dreams, See You Everyday



Going To Think Of You, On That Road Every Step Of The Way

Going To See You In My Dreams, See You Everyday



3.     Your Tears Tell, About Your Broken Heart

Your Bowing Head, Reveals Your Every Scar

I Know That You’ve Faced, Tribulations So Hard

But The Time Has Come, For Us To Be Apart

Going To Watch You Walk, As The Sound Of Your Steps Fade Away

Going To See You In My Dreams, See You Everyday



Going To Think Of You, On That Road Every Step Of The Way

Going To See You In My Dreams, See You Everyday



4.     If There’s No-One, To Prepare You For The War

You Know Zainab, Would Give Her Life For Yours

Without Any Words I'll Kneel Down On The Floor

And With These Hands, I'll Help You Climb Your Horse

Going To Help You Now, Who Will Help Me After Today

Going To See You In My Dreams, See You Everyday

Going To Think Of You, On That Road Every Step Of The Way

Going To See You In My Dreams, See You Everyday



5.     As You Walk Away, It Breaks My Heart To See

Every Few Steps, You Turn To Look At Me

You Are Strong Enough, To Handle Any Grief

But You're Broken, To Leave Your Family

Going To Smile At You, Every Time You Turn To Look My Way

Going To See You In My Dreams, See You Everyday



Going To Think Of You, On That Road Every Step Of The Way

Going To See You In My Dreams, See You Everyday



6.     I Look For A Sign, Whilst Standing On A Mound

That You're Safe With, No Enemies Around

But My Heart Shakes, And I Fall To The Ground

Watching You Lay, And Making Not A Sound

Going To Run To You, To Protect You On The Burning Plains

Going To See You In My Dreams, See You Every Day



Going To Think Of You, On That Road Every Step Of The Way

Going To See You In My Dreams, See You Everyday



7.     As I Walk Past, Your Body Tied In Chains

I Make This Vow, To You Oh My Hussain

I Will Stay Strong, And Will Bear Through Any Pains

I May Not Live, But Your Name Will Remain

Going To Make You Proud, As I'm Dragged Away From Where You Lay

Going To See You In My Dreams, See You Everyday



Going To Think Of You, On That Road Every Step Of The Way

Going To See You In My Dreams, See You Everyday



8.     You Have Left Me With A Gift I Must Return

A Little Princess For Years Who You Yearned

She Will Be Slapped Her Body Will Be Burned

She Will Die In Pain Calling You At Every Turn

Going To Lay Her Slowly Into A Dark And Empty Gave

Going To See You In My Dreams, See You Everyday



Going To Think Of You, On That Road Every Step Of The Way

Going To See You In My Dreams, See You Everyday
