To Spread Your Mission From Cradle To Grave

And So We All Stand Up As One

Resilient To All Threats That Come

2. You Taught To Be Strong Throughout Our Lives

To Face Oppression By Being Dignified

To Stare At Death In The Face With A Smile

To Sacrifice It All For The Divine

They Thought It Was Done When You Died

But Through Death You Are More Alive

You Selflessly Laid Down Your Life

4. Throughout Our Lives This Is What We've Been Taught

The Pen Is More Mightier Than The Sword

But Oh Hussain This Is What You Have Shown

Both Were Achieved By Just One Man Alone

Legacy, This Is Your Legacy



There’s No Day Like Yours Hussain

When History Remembers Your Name

5. You Called Out To Us On Top Of A Spear

And Taught Us To Live Without Any Fear

If You Will Keep Your Intentions Sincere

Whenever You Need Me I Will Be Near

When No One Is By Our Side

We Don't Care Because You're Our Guide

Legacy, This Is Your Legacy



There’s No Day Like Yours Hussain

When History Remembers Your Name

6. Every Emotion Was Felt On That Day

Hunger And Thirst With Bereavement And Pain

Seventy Two Loved Ones All Being Slain

You Knew That Your Tents Would Soon Be Aflame

And Yet You Remained Calm Within

To Prove To The World How To Win

Legacy, This Is Your Legacy



There’s No Day Like Yours Hussain

When History Remembers Your Name

On Barren Land So That No-One Would See

Heard From The Skies For All Eternity

To Prove Your Name Will Never Die

There’s No Day Like Yours Hussain

When History Remembers Your Name

8. They Say The Greatest Of All Legacies

Is Not In The Tangible That You Leave

Rather It's Based On Personality
