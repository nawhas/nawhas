Oh Fatemah, I Am So Alone

Without You Around, This House Is No Longer A Home



1. How Will I Forget, The Things That I Saw

Your Ribs That Were Crushed, The Nail And The Door

Your Tormented Cries, The Blood On The Floor

Mohsin Our Son, Whose Life Is No More

Oh Fatemah, It Broke Me To See

Though You Were In Pain, You Crawled Trying To Save Ali



Oh Fatemah, I Am So Alone

Without You Around, This House Is No Longer A Home



2. This Grief In My Heart Cannot Be Contained

But How Can I Cry In Front Of Hussain

I Wonder The Streets Without Any Aim

To Find Anyone, Who Can Share My Pain

Oh Fatemah, My Heart Sobs For You

I Cry By Myself, In Alleys That Are Destitute



Oh Fatemah, I Am So Alone

Without You Around, This House Is No Longer A Home



3. My Deep Loneliness Is Now Breaking Me

How Can I Escape This Cycle Of Grief

These Tears Are Flowing Just Like The Sea

My Love Come And See, The State Of Ali

Oh Fatemah, I Can’t See The Day

The Light Of My Eyes, And Life From Me Was Snatched Away



Oh Fatemah, I Am So Alone

Without You Around, This House Is No Longer A Home



4. They Tell Me Ali, We Thought You Were Strong

You Lifted The Gates Of Khayber Alone

So Why Is It That You Cry On And On

You Know Better Than, Us That She Is Gone

Oh Fatemah, If Only They Knew

The Bruises And Scars, I Saw When I Was Washing You



Oh Fatemah, I Am So Alone

Without You Around, This House Is No Longer A Home



5. The Children Are Searching Just For Your Scent

How Can I Explain Your Absence To Them

There Aren’t Any Words To Stop Their Lament

You Were For Them All, A Mother And Friend

Oh Fatemah, They Will Cry Aloud

When They Look At You, Laying Motionless In A Shroud



Oh Fatemah, I Am So Alone

Without You Around, This House Is No Longer A Home



6. You Know That A Day, Will Come On Hussain

He Will Be Alone, Upon Burning Plains

A Shower Of Stones And Arrows Will Rain

With 12 Blunted Strikes, His Neck Will Be Slain

Oh Fatemah, They Will Trample Him

His Chest Will Be Torn, And He’ll Bleed From His Every Limb



Oh Fatemah, I Am So Alone

Without You Around, This House Is No Longer A Home



8. You Knew All My Secrets And All My Woes

You Stayed With Me Through My Highs And My Lows

You Wiped All My Tears And Helped Me To Cope

In Each Of My Trials, You Filled Me With Hope

Oh Fatemah, The Most Perfect Wife

I Will Mourn You For, The Rest Of The Days I’m Alive



Oh Fatemah, I Am So Alone

Without You Around, This House Is No Longer A Home



9. With My Very Hands I Lay You To Sleep

I Know That You Told Me Never To Weep

But I Can’t Control The Way That I Feel

Your Death Is A Scar, That Will Never Heal

Oh Fatemah, Oh Rose Of Allah

Your Fragrance Will Stay, Forever In This Broken Heart
