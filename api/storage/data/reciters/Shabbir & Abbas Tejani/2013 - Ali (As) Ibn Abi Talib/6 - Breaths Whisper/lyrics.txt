Hussain you are my guide, in my hour of need

When I am all alone, and there’s no-one with me

Submerged in darkness, its all that i see

When I will search for you, I know that I’ll be free

Hussain you are the light, inside my darkest night

Hussain you’ve made me whole,

Through you I’ve found my soul

And everyday I say Ya Hussain



Your body was lying there, without a shroud

Completely ravaged making no sound

The enemies watched, standing so proud

As Lady Zainab cried out aloud



Hussain you are the light, inside my darkest night

Hussain you’ve made me whole,

through you I’ve found my soul

And everyday I say Ya Hussain



(Ya Hussain, Ya Hussain) x2



You taught us the art of dying, And giving others life

By being that light that’s shining, In the darkest of the nights

You showed us the way of giving, The ultimate sacrifice

Stand for what you believe in, even if you have to die



When I have got no hope, I remember your day

When I feel like I can’t cope, I think of your pain

When life can’t go on, My heart beats your name

When I’ve lost it all, My breaths whisper Hussain

Breaths whisper Hussain

Breaths Whisper Hussain
