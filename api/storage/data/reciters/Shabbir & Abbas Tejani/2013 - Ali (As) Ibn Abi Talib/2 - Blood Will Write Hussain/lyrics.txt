1.     You Can Blow Us Into Pieces, Just Like Glass Shatters To Shards

Every Drop Of Our Blood Will, Light Up The Sky Like The Stars

3.     Let Me Ask You Why You’re Killing, Such A Young Innocent Child

You May Try To Murder Him But, He Would Turn To You And Smile

How Can Your Conscience Allow This, Take A Look Into His Eye

What’s He Ever Done To Hurt You, Please Just Tell Me Whats His Crime

Is This What You’ve Learnt From Your Faith, Is This What You Call Humane

4.     Every Day We Wish We Were There, Oh Hussain (As) Right By Your Side

We Would Have Stood To Protect You, And For You We Would Have Died

Everything We Have In Your Name, Happily We’d Sacrifice

You Would Not Need To Convince Us, Or Need To Even Ask Us Twice

As We Breathe Our Final Breath For, You Our Love We Would Proclaim

5.     We Are Crying For That Martyr Who Was Stranded All Alone

He Was Shrouded By The Arrows, He Was Wounded By The Stones

Then The Enemy Began To Cut His Neck Right To The Bone

As The Heartbeats Ebbed Away His, Name In History Was Sewn

‘Pon Remembering This Image, Our Grief Cant Be Contained

If You Stop Our Lips From Moving, Through Our Blood We’ll Write Hussain



You Can Bomb Us, Shoot Us, Kill Us, But We’ll Never Feel The Pain

6.     Being Told About Hussain’s Fate, Fatema Cried Out Aloud

And The Prophet Then Consoled Her, As He Wiped The Tears He Vowed

There Will Come A Special Nation, That Will Cry For Him No Doubt

We Are Those Chosen People, That Muhammed Spoke About

The Facts Will Speak For Themselves, None Of History Will Change

If You Stop Our Lips From Moving, Through Our Blood We’ll Write Hussain



You Can Bomb Us, Shoot Us, Kill Us, But We’ll Never Feel The Pain

7.     When We Listen To Your Story, The Tejani Brothers Cry

Our Heart Is Cut To Pieces, But We Know That Every Night

Our Imam Mehdi Is Crying, Blood Is Pouring From His Eyes

And His Lips Keep On Repeating, With His Every Breathing Sigh

I’ll Avenge Karbobala When, I Will Re-Appear Again

If You Stop Our Lips From Moving, Through Our Blood We’ll Write Hussain



You Can Bomb Us, Shoot Us, Kill Us, But We’ll Never Feel The Pain

If You Stop Our Lips From Moving, Through Our Blood We’ll Write Hussain
