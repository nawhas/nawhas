Oh Ali What Has Now Happened (Where Are You My Father?) X2
I Am The Daughter Of Ali, (And My Name Is Zainab) X2

Oh Ali What Has Now Happened (Where Are You My Father?) X2

  1. Oh Father You Had Told Me When I Was Younger
There Would Come A Time When We Would Arrive In Karbala
A Caravan So Full With Brothers, Nephews And Your Sons
But How It Would Be Massacred And Be So Empty
I Never Thought That This Could Be So, (Where Would My Abbas Be?) X2

Oh Ali What Has Now Happened (Where Are You My Father?) X2
I Am The Daughter Of Ali, (And My Name Is Zainab) X2

  2. The Tortures That I've Faced The Insults That Have Been Thrown
They Snatched Away My Veil Father, My Hair Was Shown
How Much Will We Have To Suffer And Go On In Pain?
Oh Ummah Do You Not Remember We Are Ahlul Bayt
That Adhaan You Hear Now Yazid, Talks About My Grandfather (X2)

Oh Ali What Has Now Happened (Where Are You My Father?) X2

  3. When Hind Came Down Into The Cells To See The Commotion
She Came To Find The Reasons For Our Sufferings And Our Plight
Oh Prisoners What Have You Done To Deserve This Treatment
Then She Remembered That She Had Seen, My Face Before
Oh Lady Zainab It Can't Be, Are My Eyes Deceiving Me (X2)

Oh Ali What Has Now Happened (Where Are You My Father?) X2

  4. In Sham The Tyrant Yazid Was Celebrating
Raising His Brows He Taunted And Paraded Us Around
He Said: "Throw Fizza Aside So I Can See Zainab"
But Fizza Boldly Said To Him, "Desist From Evilness
If You Do This Blood Will Flow Now Like Water Inside Your Court" (X2)

Oh Ali What Has Now Happened (Where Are You My Father?) X2

  5. The Horse Came Near And I Cried Out, We Have Nothing
The Hooves Beat On The Desert Sand As It Came Closer By
Stop Please The Children Will Wake Up They've Suffered Oh So Much
The Riders Face Came Into View Could It Be My Father?
Sorrow Written Grief Stricken Too, Sombreness All Over (X2)

Oh Ali What Has Now Happened (Where Are You My Father?) X2
