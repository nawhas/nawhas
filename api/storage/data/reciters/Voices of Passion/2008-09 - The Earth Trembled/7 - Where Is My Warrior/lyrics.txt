But I see not your head, on any of these pointed spears  
How will I see you now? (x2) Where is my warrior

Let the sands rise up and, surround me like a veil  
The winds wait for your command (x2) Where is my warrior

Where have you gone to hide, why don’t you just tell me  
So that I can come to you (x2) Where is my warrior

  5. When you were young I would, sing you sweet lullabies  
I held your hand taught, you to walk oh so straight  
Now they’re making me walk, like a poor prisoner

Was not able to bear, the journey from Karbala
