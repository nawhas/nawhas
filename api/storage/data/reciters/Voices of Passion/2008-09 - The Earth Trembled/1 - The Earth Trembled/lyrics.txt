The Earth Trembled

Husayn, Husayn, Husayn (x2)

The earth trembled, the skies blackened (x2)  
Husayn has been martyred, Husayn has been martyred

  1. I told Zuljana, please don't take father  
Whoever goes, they never return  
My father then told me, to him I'm so dear (x2)  
The time has now come for us to part

The earth trembled, the skies blackened (x2)  
Husayn has been martyred, Husayn has been martyred

  2. After you were slain, they came into our tents  
They slapped me on my face and snatched my earrings  
Do they not know, we are of Ahlul Bayt (x2)  
O grandfather, where are you?

The earth trembled, the skies blackened (x2)  
Husayn has been martyred, Husayn has been martyred

  3. Sakina cannot sleep, her father has been slain  
Oh father, where are you?  
I want to lay my head, upon your chest (x2)  
When will I see you, when will I see you?

The earth trembled, the skies blackened (x2)  
Husayn has been martyred, Husayn has been martyred

  4. When I fell down from the camel's back  
Zainab cried out, no-one took heed  
But then father your head fell of Khulli's spear (x2)  
When will I see you, when will I see you?

The earth trembled, the skies blackened (x2)  
Husayn has been martyred, Husayn has been martyred

  5. The city of Shaam came out to see  
Who are these prisoners paraded through town  
Can it really be, the family of Rasool? (x2)  
Without any veils the daughters of Husayn

The earth trembled, the skies blackened (x2)  
Husayn has been martyred, Husayn has been martyred

  6. My brother Ali Asgher, he died without a drop  
Now how can I drink whilst he is thirsty?  
I want to leave this evil dungeon of Yazid (x2)  
When will I see you, when will I see you?

  
The earth trembled, the skies blackened (x2)  
Husayn has been martyred, Husayn has been martyred

  7. Oh men of Yazid, please take away this tray  
I am not hungry I want my father  
On the tray there lay my father's head (x2)  
I want to be with you, the time has now come

The earth trembled, the skies blackened (x2)  
Husayn has been martyred, Husayn has been martyred
