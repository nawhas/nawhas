Countless voices cry in mourning weeping with grief and pain
Had I a sword I would defend the veil, oh Zainab

  1. On Ashura the family of Husayn caused the earth to shake (x2)
It heard the swords clash across the field, cries of Al-Atash
Had I a sword I would defend the veil, oh Zainab

Countless voices cry in mourning weeping with grief and pain
Had I a sword I would defend the veil, oh Zainab

  2. Battle over, all the men had gone, no one there to defend (x2)
The veils were snatched, jewellery pulled from ears, Sakina's cry so pure
Had I a sword I would defend the veil, oh Zainab

Countless voices cry in mourning weeping with grief and pain
Had I a sword I would defend the veil, oh Zainab

  3. Paraded through the streets and markets to Kufa and Shaam (x2)
Oh people did you not know them, they are of Rasool
Had I a sword I would defend the veil, oh Zainab

Countless voices cry in mourning weeping with grief and pain
Had I a sword I would defend the veil, oh Zainab

  4. The court in Shaam, the palace of Yazid, tied in chains in pain (x2)
Zainab stood defending Islam for us all, so brave
Had I a sword I would defend the veil, oh Zainab

Countless voices cry in mourning weeping with grief and pain
Had I a sword I would defend the veil, oh Zainab

  5. The tragedy of the martyrs will live in our hearts (x2)
The lessons from those in Karbala, examples for us all
Had I a sword I would defend the veil, oh Zainab

Countless voices cry in mourning weeping with grief and pain
Had I a sword I would defend the veil, oh Zainab

  6. So now we stand grieving and mourning to show you Zainab (x2)
The sacrifice of Imam Husayn, we will never forget
Had I a sword I would defend the veil, oh Zainab

Countless voices cry in mourning weeping with grief and pain
Had I a sword I would defend the veil, oh Zainab
