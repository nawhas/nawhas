When A Zawwaar Visits Karbala And Sets Eyes On Baynul Haramain,

On One Side He Sees The Magnificient Shrine Of Imam Hussayn (A.s.)

And On The Other Side The Beautiful Shrine Of Hazrat Abbas (A.s.)

And The Earth Between These Two Holy Shrines Presents A Glimpse Of Heaven

– Baynul Haramain.



The Night Has Fallen On Baynul Haramayn

Zainab Is Crying Near Abbas And Husayn

The Heat’s Unbearable My Grief Unstoppable

As I Stand All Alone By The Burning Tents

All Of The Sons Are Left Laid On The Battlefield

Who’ll Pick Their Bodies Up And Bring Them Back To Me?

My Sons Were Martyred By The Ruthless Enemy

Oh Mother Please Come And Join This Pain With Me

On The Right My Dear Abbas

On The Left Mawla Husayn

Baynul Haramayn

Akhy Abbas Say Thi Ek Dharas Mujhay

Mera Shabbir Bhi Mera Muhafiz Hai

Mera Abbas (As) Jab Suwe Dariya Gaya

Mera Maqna Bhi Mera Sarse Gir Gaya

Main Hun Zainab Main Unko Yaad Karti Hun

Main Ab Bhi Karbala Say Jab Guzarti Hun

Wo Hai Ghazi Mera Wo Hai Bhayya Husayn

The Voice Of Layla Echoes Through The Night

Where Is My Akbar Did You See Him Fight

I Did Oh Layla I Held Him As He Died

And Only Allah Knows What Was My Sacrifice

Akbar My Son How Will I Live Without You Now

I’ll Join You Soon My Son This Is My Sacred Vow

Zainab Is Grieving Too

She Feels Enduring Pain

Najaf Say Ati Hai Ali Ki Ye Sada

Meri Nazron Main Hai Ab Bhi Karbala

Wo Tapti Rayt Hai Wo Jalti Khaak Hai

Yahin Par La Ilaha Illallah Bacha

Meray Do Bete The Aur Dono Shayr The

Kata Kay Apnay Sar Ko Deen Bacha Gaye

Mera Abbas Bhi Bana Misl-E Husayn

The Land Of Karbala The Desert And The Heat

The Final Resting Place Of Abbas And Husayn

The Earth Is Shaking The Skies Are Crying

The World Is Mourning Their Enduring Pain

Zainab Is Crying For Her Brothers And Her Sons

Her Tears Are Flowing With The Setting Sun

Her Heart Is Aching For Her Abbas And Husayn

The Stars Fled From The Skies They’re Hiding From My Eyes

Afraid Of What They’ll Find Within My Broken Heart

Oh Master Of The Worlds Looking From High Above

See The Arms Of My Abbas And Head Of My Hussayn

My Lord I’ll Have To Fight To Save Our True Islam

Now It’s My Turn To Show Them Who’s Daughter I Am

Looking From Left To Right, In The Desert I Remain

Hai Majid Aur Husein Sadaye Fatima

Mere Betay Hussain Godi Me Aja

Tere Maqtal Ki Khaak Ko Ay Mere Laal

Main Saaf Karti Thi Apnay Balon Say

Main Tujh Ko Yaad Kar Kay Roti Hi Rahi

Sadaein Karbala Main Deti Hi Rahi

Hain Beta Aaj Bhi Mere Lab Par Ye Beyn
