Like You Oh Husayn There Is No Other

Let Us Tell You The Story Of Karbala
Islam Is Still Alive, Just Because Of Karbala
... And Will Remain Alive, Just Because Of Karbala


Oh Hussain, Oh Hussain

You Are The Grandson Of The _Prophet_ And The Son Of The Imam
You Sacrificed _All That You Had_ So You Could Save Islam
Oh  Husayn Oh Husayn Like You There Is No Other !!

(1)

Ur Son Ali Akbar, Was So Dear To You
Bid Farewell To Your Mother _You_ Told Him To Do
You Sent Him To The Battle _Even Though_ U Knew
He Would Be Sacrificed _In_ Allah's Name Too

A Spear Was Pierced Into His Wounded Chest
He Called Out Oh My Master … This Death Is Surely Of The Best

Oh  Husayn … Oh Husayn

You Crawled Towards The Enemy To Search For Your Son
He Was The Lookalike Oof The Prophet, What Has Been Done...

Oh Hussain ……. Like You Oh Hussain ...

(2)

Your Nephew Qaasim Was Adamant To Fight
Just Like Your Brother Hassan, _Was His Face's_ Sight
For The Truth With All His _Will_ And Might
He Said I Have No Fear _If Our Path_ Is Right


Sweeter Than Honey To Me Is Death
Oh Master By Your Side, I Wish To Take My Last Breath


Oh Husayn … Oh Husayn


You Carried The Pieces Of Qaasims Trampled Body To The Tent
Oh The Final Sign Of My Beloved Brother Was Your Lament



Oh Hussain ……. Like You Oh Hussain ...


(3)

Your Sister Zaynab Brought Her Two Young Sons To You
What She Had Come For Oh Hu _Sayn_ You Knew
My Brother Please Accept My _Sacrifices_ Too
Aun And Mohd I Have _Told You_ What To Do

Fight Like No Other Make Your Dear Uncle Proud
Only Then Into The Tents … Will Your Bodies Be Allowed


Oh Husayn … Oh Husayn


Ur Nephews _Fought_ Like True Warriors But Then Were Killed
On The Scorching Sand They _Lay_ But With  Happiness, ….. Their Eyes Were
Filled


Oh Hussain ……. Like You Oh Hussain ...


(4)

There Was Abbas Your Beloved Brother
He Was _Assigned_ As The _Army's Protector_
He Made A Promise To  Hus _Ayn's_ Young Daughter
That From The River, I'll Get You Some Water

Abbas How Can I Let You Go Too
Without You Oh My Brother,  Husayn Cried What Will Iii Do

Oh Husayn … Oh Husayn

You Watched The Enemy Attack Abbas From _All_ Around ,
When Abbas Fell From His Horse You Also…., Fell To The Ground


Oh Hussain

Like You Oh Hussain …


(5)

When There Was No1 Left By Your Side
Is There Anyone To Help Me You Sighed
Then From The Tents A Holy Lady Cried


You Ran To _See_ What Had _Happened_ Inside
Out Of His Cradle Fell Your 6 Month Old Baby
His Mother Cried He's Thirsty, They'll Give Him Water Maybe

Oh  Husayn

With Asghar Towards The Enemy You _Went_ To Check
But The _Cursed_ Enemyy Shot An Arrow Through, His Fragile Neck

Oh Hussain

Like You Oh Hussain …


(6)

This Is The Only Wish Of Mahum, Saania And Adeeya
Oh Husayn You _Must_ Support Us To Fulfil Our Endeavour
In The Hearts Of Every Person Let This Feeling Be Alive
On The Lips Of Every Person Let This Chant Always Survive


Oh  Hussain (As), Oh Hussain (As), Oh Hussain (As), Oh Hussain (As)



May My Mother -- And My Father -- Be Sacrificed, For You _Oh_ Hussain (As)
…
