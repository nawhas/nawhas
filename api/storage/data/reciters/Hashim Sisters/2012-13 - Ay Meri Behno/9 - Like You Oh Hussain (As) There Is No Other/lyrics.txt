Son of Allah’s fearless warrior, Oh Hussain (as)

Master of the youth of paradise, Oh Hussain (as)

Oh the Master of Martyrs, Oh Hussain (as)

Whoever takes your name, Allah blesses them with more than they can wish for,
Oh Hussain

Angels are granted with wings in your name, Oh Hussain (as)

People are blessed with sons in your name, Oh Hussain (as)

The world sheds tears in your name, Oh Hussain (as)

Life in your name

Death in your name



Unbearable is the sorrow,

Nerve-racking is the agony you put up with

For humanity and for truth to prevail



Oh Hussain (as) Oh Hussain (as) Oh Hussain (as)



  
Like You oh Husayn there is no other  
  
Such a brave strong and loyal man  
In history you'll never see  
The world will never seee  
Let us tell you the story of Karbala  
Islam is still alive, just because of Karbala  
... and will remain alive, just because of Karbala

  
Oh Hussain, Oh Hussain  
  
You are the grandson of the _Prophet_ and the son of the Imam  
You sacrificed _all that you had_ so you could save Islam  
Oh  Husayn oh Husayn like You there is no other !!  
  
Like you oh Hussain ...

Ur son Ali Akbar, was so dear to you  
Bid farewell to your mother _you_ told him to do  
You sent him to the battle _even though_ u knew  
He would be sacrificed _in_ Allah's name too  
  
A spear was pierced into his wounded chest  
He called out oh my master … this death is surely of the best  
  
Oh  Husayn … Oh Husayn  
  
You crawled towards the enemy to search for your son  
He was the lookalike oof the Prophet, what has been done...  
  
Oh Hussain ……. Like you oh Hussain ...

Your nephew Qaasim was adamant to fight  
Just like your brother Hassan, _was His face's_ sight  
For the truth with all his _will_ and might  
He said I have no fear _if our path_ is right  
  

Sweeter than honey to me is death  
Oh master by your side, I wish to take my last breath

  
Oh Husayn … Oh Husayn  
  

You carried the pieces of Qaasims trampled body to the tent  
Oh The final sign of my beloved brother was your lament



Oh Hussain ……. Like you oh Hussain ...

Your sister Zaynab brought her two young sons to you  
What she had come for oh Hu _sayn_ you knew  
My brother please accept my _sacrifices_ too  
Aun and Mohd I have _told you_ what to do  
  
Fight like no other make your Dear Uncle proud  
Only then into the tents … will your bodies be allowed  

  
Oh Husayn … Oh Husayn

  
Ur nephews _fought_ like true warriors but then were killed  
On the scorching sand they _lay_ but with  happiness, ….. their eyes were
filled  
  

Oh Hussain ……. Like you oh Hussain ...

There was Abbas your beloved brother  
He was _assigned_ as the _army's protector_  
He made a promise to  Hus _ayn's_ young daughter  
That from the river, I'll get you some water  
  
Abbas how can I let you go too  
Without you oh my brother,  Husayn cried what will III do  
  
Oh Husayn … Oh Husayn  
  
You watched the enemy attack Abbas from _all_ around ,  
When Abbas fell from his horse You also…., fell to the ground  
  

Oh Hussain

Like you oh Hussain …

When there was no1 left by your side  
Is there anyone to help me you sighed  
Then from the tents a holy Lady cried

  
You ran to _see_ what had _happened_ inside  
Out of his cradle fell your 6 month old baby  
His mother cried he's thirsty, they'll give him water maybe  
  
Oh  Husayn  
  
With Asghar towards the enemy you _went_ to check  
But the _cursed_ enemyy shot an arrow through, his fragile neck  
  
Oh Hussain

Like you oh Hussain …

This is the only wish of MAHUM, SAANIA and ADEEYA  
Oh Husayn you _must_ support us to fulfil our endeavour  
In the hearts of every person let this feeling be alive  
On the lips of every person let this chant always survive

  
Oh  Hussain (as), Oh Hussain (as), Oh Hussain (as), Oh Hussain (as)
