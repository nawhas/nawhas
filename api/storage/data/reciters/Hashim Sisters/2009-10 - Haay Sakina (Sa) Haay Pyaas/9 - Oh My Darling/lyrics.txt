Ali Asghar, darling Asghar x4

Oh My Asghar darling Asghar x3

Little Asghar my love Asghar



You are the love of your mother, of your father and your sisters



1.     Only six months how could it be

That the tyrants were unable to see

Your innocence, your purity x2

Oh my Asghar darling Asghar



2.     Why have you gone and left us alone

Without you Asghar there is no home

There is no peace, there is no joy x2

Oh my Asghar darling Asghar



3.     I only just saw you crawl

I wanted to see you grow tall

I wanted to see you walk

I wanted to hear you talk x2

Oh my Asghar darling Asghar



4.     I can say this oh my Asghar

I promise you oh myAsghar

Now your mother will not see light x2

Oh my Asghar darling Asghar



5.     Asghar Sakina will not sleep

The emptiness of your cradle makes her weep

She will not rest or even smile x2

Oh my Asghar darling Asghar



6.     What will I say when Sughra asks me

Where have you left my brother to be?

How will I face Sughra my dear x2

Oh my Asghar darling Asghar



7.     Curse be on him to tore your throat

Curse be on him who left you so hurt

Curse of Allah on those tyrants x2

Oh my Asghar darling Asghar



8.     You were the beat set in my heart

I live for you and cant be apart

Now you sleep on the burning sand x2

Oh my Asghar darling Asghar

9.     I see no point in life anymore

My hearts in pain, I see no cure

Come to me give me some hope x2

Oh my Asghar darling Asghar



10.                        MAHUM you write of Ali Asghar

MAHUM you read of Ali Asghar

Whose mother still cries today

Oh my Asghar darling Asghar
