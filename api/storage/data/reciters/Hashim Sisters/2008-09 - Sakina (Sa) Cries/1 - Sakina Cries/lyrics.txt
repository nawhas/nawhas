(Sakina cries) x4



1.     I am the daughter of Hussain son of Ali

(Oh uncle oh Abbas now come back to me) x2



(Sakina cries) x4



2.     You said you went to get water to mend my thirst

Before the water I want you to come back first

With the help of the Lord, those tyrants will be cursed

(Uncle I wish you never went to Alqamah) x2



(Sakina cries) x4



3.     Why did I say that I was thirsty from the start

I should have stopped you and never let you depart

I should have never ever let us be apart

(Come back to me uncle and I will be happy) x2



(Sakina cries) x4



(Sakina ka yeh noha tha) x2



4.     Kash tum alqamah ki samt nahi jaate

Shaqi is tarha ham par na sitam dhaate

(Lo khabar jald bhatiji ki zara akar) x2



(Sakina ka yeh noha tha) x2



5.     Dasht mei roke Sakina yahi boli

Ham Hussain ibne Ali ki hu mei beti

(Ammu Abbas mujhe god mei lo aakar) x2



(Sakina ka yeh noha tha) x2



6.     Jald aajao mujhay piyas nahin hai ammu

Ab mujhay jeenay ki bhi aas nahin hai ammu

(Jaa(n) dedugi yahi dasht mei ro ro kar) x2



(Sakina ka yeh noha tha) x2



7.     Mujh ko dar hai kay tamachay na lagaey mere

Dur kahin kaano say is dam na chine mere

(Kahin chin jaaey sitam se na meri chadar) x2



(Sakina ka yeh noha tha) x2



8.     Noha parhti hai “dukhtaran-e-hashim”

Inko “Majid” rakhe Allah yuhi qaayam

(Karte hai ehl-e-aza bayn ye ro rokar) x2

(Sakina ka yeh noha tha) x6
